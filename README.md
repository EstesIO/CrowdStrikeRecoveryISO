# CrowdStrikeRecoveryISO

#The goal of this is to help folks recovery Windows Machines Faster. There are over 8.5M Windows computers that were affected by CrowdStrike outage

Goal is to help those SysAdmins and Non-Techincal Teams get stuff going faster and with minimal effort and Skills. This Proof of Concept ISO Build is to help try and get something that could help in Mass. 

This is currently a Work in progress, I hope to have a lightweight ISO built soon that can be put onto a USB and/or DVD and help with Fast recoverys for non-techincal users to be able to F10 boot menu any Computer and select the ISO, once complete the computer should reboot back to Windows.
